# Marketing Campaign Analysis Project
- Title: Marketing Campaign Analysis
- Created by: Ajinkya Andraskar
- Date: 29-06-2023
- Tool used: Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

# Introduction

- In this project, our objective is to delve into marketing spending data to extract valuable insights regarding the efficacy of diverse marketing campaigns. To achieve 
  this, we will harness the power of SQL to extract and manipulate the dataset, enabling us to perform a comprehensive analysis. By doing so, we aim to uncover the 
  underlying drivers of campaign performance and offer actionable recommendations for enhancement. 
- Our analysis will involve a thorough exploration of the interplay between various key variables, including campaign dates, revenue figures, conversion rates, average 
  order values, and the impact of geographic targeting. Through this examination, we endeavor to gain a profound understanding of the factors that influence the success of 
  marketing initiatives. This project not only serves as an opportunity to showcase SQL skills but also offers meaningful insights that can drive strategic decision-making 
  in the realm of marketing.
- The analysis will help us understand the factors influencing campaign performance and provide recommendations for improvement.
- We will examine the relationship between different variables such as campaign date, revenue, conversion rates, and average order values and geographic targeting.

# Dataset Overview
- The dataset we will be working with is sourced from the 'marketing' database, and it comprises 308 records. Each record contains a wealth of information about different 
  marketing campaigns, encompassing attributes that play a pivotal role in gauging campaign success.

# Columns in the Dataset

We will use the 'marketing' database, which contains information on marketing campaigns. The dataset includes the following columns:

- Date: The date on which the marketing budget was allocated for the campaign.
- Campaign Name: A descriptive label for the campaign, providing insight into its purpose and focus.
- Category: The classification of the marketing source, highlighting the campaign's nature.
- Campaign ID: A unique identifier assigned to each campaign for easy tracking and referencing.
- Impressions: The number of times the campaign's ad has been displayed.
- Market Budget: The financial resources allocated to the campaign on the specified date.
- Clicks: The count of individuals who clicked on the campaign banner, thereby visiting the associated website.
- Leads: The quantity of individuals who not only clicked but also signed up, sharing their credentials.
- Orders: The number of successful transactions where customers made a purchase.
- Revenue: The total monetary value generated by the campaign.
- Geo Type: The categorization of the geographic location, such as Borough, CD, Citywide, UHF42.
- Geo Join ID: An identifier uniquely assigned to each geographic location.
- Geo Place Name: The name associated with the geographic location.

# Approach:

- Data Acquisition and Preparation:

  Retrieve the marketing spending data from the 'marketing' database.
  Import the data into a SQL database for analysis.

- Data Cleaning and Standardization:

  Use SQL queries to clean the data, handling duplicates and missing values.
  Standardize data formats for consistency.

- Basic Metrics Extraction:

  Utilize SQL to extract essential information, such as total spending, revenue, impressions, clicks, leads, and orders.

- Marketing Metrics Calculation:

  Calculate Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) using the formula: (Total Earnings - Marketing Cost) / Marketing Cost.
  Compute Cost per Click (CPC), Cost per Lead (CPL), and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) using relevant formulas.
  Determine Average Order Value (AOV) by dividing Revenue by the Number of Orders.

- Conversion Rate Analysis:

  Calculate Conversion Rate 1: Leads / Clicks.
  Calculate Conversion Rate 2: Orders / Leads.

- Campaign Performance Analysis:

  Analyze the performance of campaigns based on the date. Identify dates with the highest spending, revenue, and conversion rates.
  Calculate average order values for different dates.

- Buyer Behavior Analysis:

  Analyze buyer activity by comparing average revenue on weekdays and weekends.
  Understand how customer behavior varies based on the day of the week.

- Campaign Type Effectiveness:

  Evaluate the effectiveness of different campaign types (e.g., social, banner, influencer, search) using ROMI and other metrics.
  Determine which campaign types yield the best results.

- Geographic Targeting Insights:

  Compare the effectiveness of campaigns targeting different geographic locations (boroughs, CDs, citywide, UHF42).
  Identify the most lucrative geographic areas based on revenue and other metrics.

- Interpretation and Recommendations:

  Interpret the results obtained from the analysis.
  Provide actionable recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies and improving campaign effectiveness.

- Data-Driven Decision-Making:

  Use the insights gained to make informed decisions regarding future marketing campaigns.
  Implement changes based on the recommendations to enhance marketing ROI.

# SQL Functions Used:

- DDL (Data Definition Language)
- DML (Data Manipulation Language)
- Joins (including multiple joins)
- Subqueries (including nested subqueries)
- Case statements
- Logical conditions
- Window functions

# Metrics Analyzed:

- Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI):
   > Return on marketing investments, how effective is marketing campaign, one metric that shows effectiveness of every rupee spent. It is calculated ( Total earning (Revenue) - Marketing cost ) / Marketing cost ).
- Cost per Click (CPC):
   > How much does it cost us to attract 1 click (on average) (Marketing spending/Clicks).
- Cost per Lead (CPL):
   > How much does it cost us to attract 1 lead (on average) (Marketing spending/Leads).
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
   > How much does it cost us to attract 1 order (on average)(marketing spend/ orders).
- Average Order Value (AOV):
   > Average order value for this campaign (Revenue/Number of Orders).
- Conversion Rate 1:
   > Conversion from visitors to leads for this campaign (Leads/Click).
- Conversion Rate 2:
   > Conversion rate from leads to sales (Orders/Leads).
- Click-through Rate (CTR):
   > Percentage of people who clicked at banner (Clicks/ Impressions).
- Gross Profit
   > Profit or loss after deducting marketing cost (Revenue-Marketing spending).

These metrics provide actionable insights for evaluating campaign effectiveness and making informed business decisions.
